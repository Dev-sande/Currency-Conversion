Step-by-Step:

1. We begin by importing the CurrencyRates class from the forex_python.converter module.
2. We create an instance of the CurrencyRates class using c = CurrencyRates().
3. The user is prompted to input the amount they want to convert, as well as the source and target currencies.
4. We display a message indicating the conversion about to take place.
5. The convert method of the CurrencyRates instance is called with the source currency, target currency, and amount as arguments.
6. The result of the conversion is stored in the result variable.
7. Finally, we display the converted result.
